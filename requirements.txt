1. Tkinter (GUI Library)

Manages windows, buttons, labels, and canvas elements.

2. Time (Time Management)

Used for stopwatch functionality.

3. Math (Mathematical Operations)

Used for calculating the angle and position of the stopwatch needle.

tk is included by default with Python, so you donâ€™t need to install it manually using pip.

time and math are built-in Python modules, so no external installation is required.
